# Working-with-CARLA
A repo for client code to interact with CARLA and any associated data and models.

The original work done by [sentex](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfzlCWGWYyIQ0aLC5w48gBQ) was for
TensorFlow 1.0 so there are a number of places that need updating to TensorFlow 2.0.

I'm slowly working through those updates and figuting out the errors as I go.
